# MMA-data
This is for side projects about analyzing MMA data. The data files are taken from Renaissanc3Man's repo "MMA-Data" (see link below) so all the credit for web scraping, cleaning the data files and so on goes to Renaissanc3Man, I just found the repo and decided to toy around with the data provided.
