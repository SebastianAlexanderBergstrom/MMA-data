# MMA-data
This is for side projects about analyzing mixed marital arts (MMA) data. The data files are taken from Renaissanc3Man's repo "MMA-Data" (see link below) so all the credit for web scraping, cleaning the data files and so on goes to Renaissanc3Man, I just found the repo and decided to toy around with the data provided.

The current code was used to get an idea if MMA in the UFC has changed since the organization announced that it would implement stricter doping controls in February of 2015. The analysis is available as blog posts, see link below.
